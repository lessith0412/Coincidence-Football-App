# coincidence

Welcome to The COINCIDENCE LEAGUE.
This app contains the information about the live score and the player's team as well as there position.

## Getting Started

Here I have use the dart and flutter for creating the project.
I have shown here the Firebase Authentication ie which will allow you to Sign with:
     0. Splash Screen(Video Player)
     1. Email
     2. Phone Number
     3. Google Sign IN

Here I have used the module in flutter called video player for using the video which is featured as the splash screen.
As you can see also here I have use the object oriented property of the programming language ie using inheritance in widget method.

Here I have taken the Auth from the firebase and it will check whether the credential are proper or not.
As say that the password should be of atleast 6 characters.

Here then I have provided the Single Child Scroll view in the home page.
I have used the Custom card layout for presenting the teams.
Here by clicking on the player you can also see the player featured card.
